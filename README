INTRODUCTION

    py-lispnetworking - A python module to deal with LISP control-plane packets

LISP stands for Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol. It is a protocol which
is being developed inside the IETF (Internet Engineering TaskFore) and is 
completely open. 

From www.lisp4.net: 

    "LISP is a network architecture and set of protocols that implements a new
    semantic for IP addressing. In a nutshell: LISP separates the 'where' and 
    the 'who' in networking and uses a mapping system to couple the location
    and identifier."

This software aims to help encode and decode LISP control-plane packets.

It adheres to the following Internet Drafts:

    - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lisp-13
    - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-farinacci-lisp-lcaf-05

    - http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lisp/charter/

This software is based on scapy.
